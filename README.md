# psconf.eu2025: Small, Powerful, and soon your best friend: ScriptBlocks

> Someone’s got to do the work, let it better not be you.
> In this entertaining session spiced with plenty of code examples to take away, Tobias explains why scriptblocks really *are* the essence of PowerShell, and how you can use them to your advantage for scoping, streaming, code analysis, build time capsules, and more.
>At the end of this session, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of PowerShell’s pipeline, functions, and scoping mechanisms. Plus, you’ll walk away with effective strategies to streamline your code and let scriptblocks do plenty of heavy lifting for you.


This repo serves as code base for the session.
